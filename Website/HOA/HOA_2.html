        Greetings of the day everyone, this is <b>Khushi</b> and I am pursuing Diploma in Architectural Assistantship. I hope you liked my previous blog. So, in this blog, We talk about Temple Architecture.<br><br>

        In HINDU ARCHITECTURE we have many varieties, styles and features. It is also known as TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;➢NORTHERN HINDU STYLE<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;➢CENTRAL HINDU STYLE<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;➢SOUTH HINDU STYLE<br><br>

        <b><u>NORTHERN HINDU STYLE</u></b><br><br>
          ❖ This style had spread over at least 3rd to 4th part of northern India.<br>
          ❖The earliest monument started in the state of Orissa, its ancient name is Kalinga.<br>
          ❖ It is offered strong resistance to Maurya’s but finally subdued to Ashoka in 260 BC.<br>
          ❖ After Ashoka’s death Kalinga more powerful under kharavela.<br>
          ❖Beginning of this group is seen at Bhubaneshwar where there are thirty temples.<br>
          ❖The most important are the temple of Jagannath at Puri, Mahashiva gupta yayati, sun temple at Konark. <br>
          ❖The other groups are confined to some area such as at Khajuraho, the latest of entire series is shiva temple of kendariya Mahadeva at Khajuraho.<br><br>

        <b><u>TEMPLE OF ORISSA GROUP (KALINGA)</u></b><br><br>
        ❖SUN TEMPLE OF KONARK<br>
          The magnificent temple was therefore built to glorify.
          Surya “the sun god at Konark.<br><br>

        The temple of sun god, Surya’s, the source of life, origin of light, the dispeller of darkness, and sin, the source and instrument of purity and heath is unique in its construction.<br><br>

        The plan of this temple was that of genius and its scale was too great for its execution.<br><br>

        The temple is formed like a, ratha or wheeled chariot being
        carried by seven.<br><br>

        Horses symbolizing the seven rays of the sun who blazes his way through the heaven and proceeded by the charioteer Arun.<br><br>

        The temple resting on a large platform with 12 giant wheels.<br><br>

        It is curved with erotic surfaces and decorated with medallion on the spokes a hub.<br><br>

        On its three sides, in the middle segments there are three subsidiary shrines with stairways leading to niches each containing the life – size image of sun gods minutely curved.<br><br>

        The wall fully sculptured with beautiful dancers playing or musical instruments.<br><br>

        Two gracefully carved elephant guard its entrance.<br><br>

        The width of the cubical portion or, Bada of jaga Mohan is
        twice its own height. <br>
        Upper tapering part, pida “and which is crowned with a melon shaped 'kalasha' or amalaka is flueted.<br><br>

        Outer surface of Bada sculpted with as many as fifteen hundred elephants in different patterns, along with soldiers riding on horses in a bottom row.<br><br>

        symbolism o prakriti ana purusha.<br><br>

        <b><u>CENTRAL HINDU STYLE</u></b><br><br>
        EARLY CHALUKYAN ARCHITECTURE<br><br>
        The architecture falls into two distinct types:- <br>
        I. ROCK-CUT CAVE<br>
        II. STRUCTURAL<br><br>

        ROCK-CUT CAVE TEMPLES AT BADAMI<br><br>

      <h4 id="education">
        • The chalukyan capital city Badami was protected by a fort was surrounded by a moat.<br>
        • The superfluous water of agatyathirtha was a sporting place of the royal families.<br>
        • Badami was also a religious center.<br>
        • Goddess Banashankari was a presiding deity.<br>
        • The most interesting from architectural point of view is a series of cave temple hewn from top to bottom in the scrap of a southern hill called ran Mandal.<br>
        • These are Brahminical in nature, one shavite, two vishnavites, and the fourth belongs to jaina.<br><br> 

        Structural temples<br><br>

        In addition to the rock cut cave temples at Badami chalukyas also built several structural temples along the edge of the lake and hill tops.<br> 
        The early chalukyas combined some features of contemporary north and south Indian style of construction.<br><br>

        Style of Construction<br><br>
        Which is characterized by high platforms, pithas ornate door frames, plinth molding, vestibule.<br><br> 

        <b><u>SOUTHERN HINDU STYLE</u></b><br><br>
        South Hindu style is also known as dravida style architecture.<br><br>

        In south style temples consist essentially of a square chambered sanctuary topped by a super structure, tower, or spire and an attached pillared porch or hall(mandapa) enclosed by a peristyle of cells within a rectangular court.<br><br>

        The origins of the Dravida style can be observed in the Gupta period.<br><br>
